# StudyNotion — Full-Stack EdTech Platform

StudyNotion is a full‑stack educational platform built with JavaScript. It provides a modern, modular foundation for hosting courses, managing users and instructors, delivering lessons, running quizzes and assignments, and integrating payments and real‑time features for live classes and chats.

> NOTE: This README is a starting point. Update the environment variables, scripts, and deployment steps below to match this repository's actual structure (monorepo, separate `client`/`server` folders, or single app).

## Key features
- User authentication (students & instructors)
- Course creation and management (lessons, modules, resources)
- Video and content delivery (streaming or external embeds)
- Quizzes, assignments, grading, and progress tracking
- Payment integration for paid courses (Stripe/PayPal)
- Real-time features (chat, live classes / WebRTC)
- Admin dashboard and reporting
- Roles & permissions
- Notifications (email / in-app)

## Tech stack
- Language: JavaScript (frontend + backend)
- Frontend: React / Next.js (or plain React) — replace with actual framework used
- Backend: Node.js + Express (or other JS backend)
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL (choose as used)
- Authentication: JWT / sessions
- Payments: Stripe / PayPal
- Realtime: Socket.IO or WebRTC
- Dev tooling: ESLint, Prettier, Jest (tests)

Adjust the list above to reflect the exact technologies used in this repo.

## Getting started (local development)

1. Clone the repo
   - git clone https://github.com/Koushikpali/StudyNotion---Full-Stack-Ed-Tech-Platform.git
   - cd StudyNotion---Full-Stack-Ed-Tech-Platform

2. Install dependencies
   - If the project is a monorepo with `client/` and `server/`:
     - cd server && npm install
     - cd ../client && npm install
   - If single project:
     - npm install

3. Configure environment variables
   - Copy the example env file:
     - cp .env.example .env
   - Edit `.env` with your credentials and keys (examples below).

4. Run the app (common patterns)
   - Server: npm run dev (or `npm start` / `nodemon src/index.js`)
   - Client: npm run dev (or `npm start` within `client/`)
   - If monorepo, you might use a root script like `npm run dev:all` to start both.

5. Build for production
   - Client: npm run build
   - Server: set NODE_ENV=production and start the server process manager (pm2, systemd, Docker)

## Example environment variables
Replace these with the actual variables used by the repo:
- PORT=4000
- MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster0.mongodb.net/studynotion
- DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/studynotion
- JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
- JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
- SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
- SMTP_PORT=587
- SMTP_USER=you@example.com
- SMTP_PASS=supersecret
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api

## Typical project structure
(Adapt to actual layout)
- /client — Frontend application (React/Next)
- /server — Backend API (Node.js/Express)
- /scripts — Utility scripts (seed, migrations)
- /config — Configuration and env loading
- /docs — Design docs, API specs
- /tests — Automated tests

## Common npm scripts
(Verify and update to match package.json)
- npm run dev — start development server
- npm run start — start production server
- npm run build — build production assets
- npm run lint — run linters
- npm run test — run test suite
- npm run seed — seed the database with sample data
- npm run migrate — run DB migrations

## Database & migrations
- If using MongoDB: include seed scripts and models under `/server/models`
- If using SQL (Postgres): include migration commands (Knex, Sequelize, TypeORM)

## Deploying
You can deploy StudyNotion using:
- Docker: Provide Dockerfile and docker-compose (service: web, db)
- Cloud platforms: Vercel for frontend (Next.js), Render/Heroku/DigitalOcean for backend
- Kubernetes: Create manifests/Helm charts for production environments

Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to run tests, lint, and deploy.

## Running tests
- npm run test
- For end-to-end tests: use Cypress or Playwright (add corresponding commands)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Typical workflow:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feat/my-feature
3. Install dependencies and run tests locally
4. Open a pull request with a clear description and screenshots (if UI changes)

Please follow the repo's code style (ESLint/Prettier rules) and include tests for new features.

## Roadmap / Ideas
- Improve accessibility and mobile UX
- Add SCORM/LTI support for LMS integration
- Expand analytics and instructor reporting
- Add multi-tenant support and white-labeling
- Improve localization / i18n

## Troubleshooting
- Common issues:
  - "Cannot connect to DB": check MONGO_URI/DATABASE_URL and ensure database is running and accessible.
  - "Stripe webhook failed": verify webhook signing secret and endpoint configuration.
  - "CORS errors": check server CORS settings and client API URL.
